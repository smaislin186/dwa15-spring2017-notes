# Namespacing

The topic of namespacing was first introduced when we [learned about Classes in PHP](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-spring2017-notes/blob/master/02_PHP/12_Classes.md#namespacing).

To recap: Namespacing is a programming feature that helps prevent **name collisions**. Name collisions occur when two different packages of code try to use the same class names.

Not only does namespacing help prevent name collisions, it also helps power [__autoloading__](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php).

Autoloading is a feature PHP has which makes it possible to invoke classes in your code without having to explicitly require the corresponding class files. Instead, the class is loaded as needed, when invoked.

In order for autoloading to work, you have to first give your autoloading function some details about *where* to find your classes.

In Laravel, there's some autoloading configured in `composer.json` :

```json
"autoload": {
    "classmap": [
        "database"
    ],
    "psr-4": {
        "App\\": "app/"
    }
},
```

This is using 2 different methods of setting up your autoloading:

1. By `classmap`. This is simply autoloading by directory. It's saying &ldquo;*Look in the `database/` directory, you'll find classes there*&rdquo;.

2. By `psr-4`. This is where namespacing and autoloading join forces.

`psr-4` is one of several PSRs (PHP Standard Recommendation) designed by the PHP [__FIG - Framework Interoperability Group__](http://www.php-fig.org/).

Read more here: [PSR-4: Autoloading Standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)

What PSR-4 does is creates a correlation between your class names and the location of your class files.

So, for example if you had PSR-4 configured and used this class setup:

```php
namespace Texter;

class Message() {

}
```

...your autoloader would look for this class at `Texter\Message.php`.


## PSR-4 in Laravel
Looking at `composer.json` in Laravel 5 we see this PSR-4 setting:

```json
"psr-4": {
    "App\\": "app/"
}
```

The key `App` is the namespace and `app/` is the file path.

The `\\` after App is used to prevent name collisions with other namespaces like, for example, `Apples` or `Application`.

This key-value pair indicates that when we use a namespace that starts with `App`, the autoloader should look for the corresponding file in `app/`.

You can see this in action in our `BookController.php`.

At the top, the namespace is set to:

```xml
namespace App\Http\Controllers;
```

And the path to the file corresponds at:

```xml
app/Http/Controllers/BookController.php
```

Note that if you had changed your App name after first installing Laravel (`php artisan app:name Foobooks`), that would be reflected here:

```json
"psr-4": {
    "Foobooks\\": "app/"
}
```


The `app` folder is just one of the folders that is PSR-4 autoloaded in Laravel.

There's more autoloading going on under the hood by default with Composer&mdash; for example everything in the `/vendor` directory is autoloaded.




## Summary
Namespacing...

1. helps avoid name collisions.
2. helps power autoloading by mapping namespaced class names to file paths.
